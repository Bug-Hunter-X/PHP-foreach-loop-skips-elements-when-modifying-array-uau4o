This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP involving the use of foreach loops to modify arrays during iteration.  The issue arises because unset()ing elements within the loop affects the array indices, causing some elements to be skipped. The solution presents alternative strategies to safely modify arrays within loops.  This is a valuable example for anyone learning PHP, or for experienced developers as a refresher on potential pitfalls of array manipulation.
